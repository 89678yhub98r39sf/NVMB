# NVMB
- WORK IN PROGRESS
- Stands for Network of Virtual Machine Blocks.
- A simulation of a decentralized undirected network system.
- Decentralization is implemented by partitioning of global(network) and local (node) data into discrete parts.

# Dependencies
- Recommended libraries to have are:
  * OpenMP
- Required libraries are:
  * GoogleTest

## [FUTURE] Machine-learning
The machine-learning algorithms used in this project is to aid in a 
Node's decision-making. Because of this daunting requirement, I have 
decided to take the easier route in devising the decision-making protocol 
of Nodes. The machine-learning infrastructure for each node will consist 
of a pipeline of machine-learning algorithms. Some of the logistics of 
these algorithms are based on arbitrarily-defined rules. These rules 
include but are not limited to the following: 
- structures that will aid and abet in a Node's learning of its environment.
- regulations that enable a Node to seek and forecast. 
- abilities that allow a Node to transcend its currency.
- theoretics that grant definition to a Node to "think","move",and "feel".
- a plethora of synergy that when combined with the Node class allows 
  transformation, activation, and devastation.
- tolerance towards some factors and conditions and resistance against 
  other factors and conditions, and the really interesting thing is that 
  the factors and conditions that are tolerable by one Node at one instance cannot also be resisted by the same Node at the same instance.
